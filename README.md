# Banker's Algorithm with GUI
This is an implementation of the banker's algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in C#. The program allows users to specify the number of processes and resources, and the maximum and available resources for each process. It then calculates whether the system is in a safe state and displays the result on the GUI.
#Installation
