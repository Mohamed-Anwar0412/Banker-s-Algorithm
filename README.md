# Banker's Algorithm with GUI
This is an implementation of the banker's algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in C#. The program allows users to specify the number of processes and resources, and the maximum and available resources for each process. It then calculates whether the system is in a safe state and displays the result on the GUI.
# Installation
To use this program, you will need to have Visual Studio installed on your computer. Once you have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installed, you can download or clone the repository from GitHub. <br /><br />
**Open the solution file Banker's Algorithm.sln in Visual Studio and build the project.**
# Usage
When you run the program, you will see:
- a GUI that allows you to specify the number of processes and resources<br />
